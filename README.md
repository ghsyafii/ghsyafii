### Hi, I'm Syafii. üëã

Here's a selection of recent projects:

<h3><a href="https://ob-strat.netlify.app" target="_blank">Oblique Strategies</a></h1>

In the '70s, pioneering musician Brian Eno released Oblique Strategies, a collection of aphorisms printed on 100+ cards. It was meant to help artists generate ideas and break out of stale patterns. This web version was designed to be as intuitive and stripped-down as possible, in line with the original product's spirit. Check it out <a href="https://ob-strat.netlify.app" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h3><a href="https://ssa-furniture.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">SSA Furniture</a></h3>
  
This e-commerce site was built with a fellow developer using Node.js and MongoDB on the backend. I designed and coded the UI, and implemented CRUD operations for products and user login/registration/authentication. It's mobile responsive, so it looks equally good on both üñ•Ô∏è and your üì±.

<h3><a href="https://wither-the-weather.netlify.app">What's the weather like in your city?</a></h3>

Yes, you could find out whether it's balmy or blizzarding in [insert city here] by summoning Siri, but you could also use this nifty web app I built that grabs data from the <a href="https://developer.accuweather.com">AccuWeather API</a>. Results from the last query persists thanks to localStorage, and it's also an installable Chrome web app, courtesy of <a href="https://pep.dev">Pep</a>.

<h3><a href="https://syafii.co">syafii.co</a></h3>

My personal website. Well, it's a virtual business card more than anything, really. Click the button on the bottom-right corner to change the colour of the background‚Äîthe colour of the text dynamically alters so it's readable no matter how bright or dark the background gets. How did I do it? It's a secret. Kidding, I used the very cool <a href="https://gka.github.io/chroma.js/">chroma.js</a> JavaScript library. Check it out <a href="https://syafii.co">here</a>.
