### Hi, I'm Syafii. 👋

Here's a selection of recent projects:

<h3><a href="https://ob-strat.netlify.app">Oblique Strategies</a></h1>

In the '70s, pioneering musician Brian Eno released Oblique Strategies, a collection of aphorisms printed on 100+ cards. It was meant to help artists generate ideas and break out of stale patterns. This web version was designed to be as intuitive and stripped-down as possible, in line with the original product's spirit. Check it out <a href="https://ob-strat.netlify.app">here</a>.

<h3><a href="https://ssa-furniture.herokuapp.com">SSA Furniture</a></h3>
  
This e-commerce site was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap on the frontend, and Node.js and MongoDB on the backend. I designed and coded the UI, and implemented CRUD operations for products and user login/registration/authentication. It's mobile responsive, so it looks equally dope on both 🖥️ and your 📱. Check it out <a href="https://ssa-furniture.herokuapp.com">here</a>.
